### What is Nash

Nash is a memory safe compiled programming language (yes, another one). It currently transpiles to C, but the goal is to later use our own custom backends.

### Why am I making Nash

Im too lazy to learn rust and I don't like the syntax at all. I think typescripts syntax looks cleaner and feels better to write. So I'm going to use typescript inspiration for the syntax, as well as adding my own ideas. This project is not a typescript compiler though, it is it's own language.

### Goals

    - Support tcc for compiling transpiled code. If we need complex features, we will implement them.
    - Memory safety
    - No super complex syntax
    - Easy and powerful standard library
    - Can build low level projects (example: Kernels/Os drivers)
    - Supports dynamic typing (this will cause it be slower  when in use, but it will be an option)
